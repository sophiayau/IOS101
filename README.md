## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I was having some trouble understanding the syntax of the code that was provided. The placement of the syntax, especially for the functions, was a bit confusing. There are also some features on this IDE that I haven't fully grasped.
